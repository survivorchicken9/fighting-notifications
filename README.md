Hi SJ. This is to make you less bored and more importantly me less bored because I only have one friend and you're busy doing your military service.
You probably already have some kind of countdown for your military service but I thought this would be cool anyways.

## Setting it up
To anyone else that's here- basically just go into /templates/home.html and change the countDownDate variable to whenever your best friend is getting out of military. 

## Stuff to fix
Ideally make this thing log-in-able and customizable for many users and yeah just better.

Check the pipfile for list of dependencies.
